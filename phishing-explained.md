# Phishing â€” Short Explanation

## What is phishing?
Phishing uses fake messages or pages to trick people into giving secrets (passwords, tokens).

## Common methods
- Email with malicious links
- Fake login pages that look real
- SMS or chat messages that ask to click a link

## Why it works
Phishing plays on trust and haste. Users see trusted logos and act quickly.

## Ethical simulations
Security teams and educators run controlled simulations to train users. Always run these in a lab, get consent, and follow laws and company policy.

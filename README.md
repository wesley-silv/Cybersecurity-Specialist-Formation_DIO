# Phishing Awareness Lab — Ethical Demo

## ⚠️ Ethical Notice
This project is for education only. Do NOT use any part of this repository to collect real credentials, attack people, or deploy fake pages on the public internet. All demos use dummy data and run locally or inside an isolated VM. Always get written consent if you test with real people.

## Short objective
Show how phishing works in a safe lab environment, explain detection methods, and document technical decisions. No real passwords are captured.
